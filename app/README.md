## Introduction

### Your data is decentralized

Everyone can host their own backend. See [here](https://docs.flow.linwood.tk/server/getting-started) and everyone can
add it to the server list in the settings.

### Manage your time everywhere

You don't need a server. Everything can be saved on the local device or in the cloud.
